1. hbait card should show current value if the habit type is value.

2. the qualty deailts scfreen if the habit has a qilty layer show the streak for qulaty layer prgess under the nomal deails not split them via seclect widget if no qulty then dont show that section at all

3. the edit value for habit in the cakender should load with the current value not 0 
and also the qulty is yes no , so like if i have 20 reps with qulty layer labled focused so i click the value 20 and ticke focused thats it means done 20 reps and was focsue not 20 focused reps and not counting towards 20 reps its the same reps am not really sure if the system currenyy dopes that dont change without checking cuurent imepplementation

4. create the home screen to show all habvtis and tasks due today in a sinle list dorted byt time under welcme user name and also saying x tkas and habits with a prgress bar at the top of the list and soem messges like lets get strated almsot there foign well and done for the day depeing on precentage completed

5. the app somtimes laods outside shell causing unsbality make sure this never happens and closing starting he app alwyas sttarts inside the shell

6. oping the side bar in the taks screen doesnt work

7. the habit card isnt showing accuret strek numberss smilar to the one in the habti deails screen AND THE PERCANTGE ITS SHOWING is also place holder no caludalcted and it doenst have a place to tick or add one to the value of today so fix that , the previous befoer of the tick box
yes no habits click turns done.

for vlaude a tick adds one if goal reached then a tick show the fill dialog where ucan tick teh qulty options aside the actul value number. 
if the habit is min a click adds only and qulty cant be ticked unless u click in teh calneder in the habit deatils screen this is already implemnted but add that in the comments to do later.
